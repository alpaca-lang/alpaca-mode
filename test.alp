module test

-- one function that takes a single argument will be publicly accessible:
export double/1

{- Our double function defines an "add" function inside of itself.
   Comments for now are C-style.

-- Basic ADT with type constructors:
type even_or_odd = Even int | Odd int

-- A function from integers to our ADT:
even_or_odd x =
  let rem = x % 2 in
  match rem with
      0 -> Even x
    | _ -> Odd x
